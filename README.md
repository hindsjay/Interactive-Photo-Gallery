# Treehouse Techdegree - Project 5 - An Interactive Photo Gallery

This project served as an introduction to JavaScript and using jQuery plugins.

Task was to create a photo gallery that included a lightbox when the user clicks on a thumbnail.  We were to search and find an appropriate jQuery plugin that enabled the lightbox feature.  

The project also included a search feature to filter the thumbnails based on the input in the search field.  We were tasked to write our own JavaScript code to enable this search feature.
